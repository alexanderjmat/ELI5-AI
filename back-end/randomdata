  "article": "\nAnswer:\nHeadline: AI Platform Generates Game Art Assets, Scenario Lands $6M in Funding\n\nScenario, a game art asset platform, has recently secured $6M in funding from venture capital firms. The platform uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate high-quality art assets for video games, making the process of creating art assets faster and more efficient. The platform also includes an online marketplace where game developers can buy and sell art assets.\n\nScenario CEO, Kenneth Wong, said that the platform is designed to help indie game developers and small companies who have limited resources. He added that the platform will enable game developers to create art assets faster and more affordably. \n\nThe $6M in funding will be used to expand the platform's capabilities and improve its scalability. Wong said that the team is also working on a real-time 3D engine which will enable developers to create art assets in real-time.\n\nThe funding round was led by venture capital firm Greycroft, with participation from other VCs such as First Round Capital, Makers Fund, and Omidyar Network. \n\nScenario's platform is just one example of how AI can be used to make game development more efficient. With this new funding, the platform can continue to grow and help more game developers create art assets quickly and affordably."
