# Schema

## Description

The database schema above is designed for the ELI5-AI app, which delivers daily digestible summaries of the latest news in AI and Machine Learning. The schema includes four tables: subscribers, news_data, summaries and newsletter_entries.

The subscribers table has an id column, an email column, and a subscription_status column. The email column is set as UNIQUE and NOT NULL, and the subscription_status column is set as NOT NULL with a default value of true. This table stores the information of the subscribers, who will receive the newsletter.

The news_data table has an id column, a title column, a description column, a body column, a url column, and a date_published column. All columns are set as NOT NULL. This table stores all the news data, collected by MediaStack, which the app will use to generate the summaries.

The summaries table has an id column, a news_data_id column, and a summary column. The news_data_id column references the id column in the news_data table. This table stores the summaries generated by the OpenAI's Davinci or GPT-3 API for each news item in the news_data table.

The newsletter_entries table has an id column, a summary_id column, and a date_sent column. The summary_id column references the id column in the summaries table. This table stores the newsletter entries, which are a group of summaries sent to the subscribers on a specific date.

This database schema is designed to store all the relevant data for the ELI5-AI app, in order to generate and send the newsletter to the subscribers. The tables are connected through foreign keys, making it easy to retrieve the related data.
